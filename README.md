# ZZ3_grails_app
ZZ3 project on Grails to create a stackoverflow-like. A gamification will be in place to reward users.


## Expected features
* The project will offer a system to ask and answer questions.
* An answer can be upvoted. It means it's the more accurate answer for the question. Of course, they can also be downvoted.
* The answers will be ordered by number of votes, this feature should be a matter of presentation.
* Questions can also be voted to reflect their interests in the community.
* A question can be tagged to appear in categories.
* A question or an answer can be edited to add some additional information or to fix a typo.
* A reputation mechanism brings a gamification to the application (The rules have to be defined).
* Some actions (to be defined) will allow the user to gain some badges (part of the gamification).
* Users can fill a profile.
* The profile will sum up all the user's actions (questions asked, answers given, edits, ...) and the earned reputation.
* The profile will compute the grand total

## Organization
